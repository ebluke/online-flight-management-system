# CSIT214 'Group' Assignment

## Installation

git clone https://github.com/csit214-jeaans/online-flight-management-system
```

## How to run

cd online-flight-management-system/
yarn
yarn start

## Tips

Run at 1080p 100% for best viewing experience, this application hasn't been polished and is a rush job.

## What doesn't work

I have scrapped the backened for compelexity sake. Now everything is run in a live session, if you refresh the browser, the UserDataStore
will clean it self and return to default.
